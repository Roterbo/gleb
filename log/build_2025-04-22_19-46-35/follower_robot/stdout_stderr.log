[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findspatial_utils.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "spatial_utils", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "spatial_utils"
  with any of the following names:

    spatial_utilsConfig.cmake
    spatial_utils-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "spatial_utils" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "spatial_utils_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "spatial_utils" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
